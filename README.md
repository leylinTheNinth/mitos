# MIT 6.S081 Operating Systems Engineering Labs

This repository contains my solutions for the lab components of the MIT 6.S081 Operating Systems Engineering course, as outlined in the [Fall 2023 course schedule](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2023/schedule.html). The course introduces several fundamental concepts in operating systems, including processes, system calls, virtual memory, and more, through a series of hands-on lab exercises.

## Course Overview

MIT 6.S081 is an undergraduate course that provides practical experience with operating systems development. The course includes a series of labs focusing on modifying and extending a simple Unix-based operating system called xv6. More information about the course can be found on the [official course page](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2020/schedule.html).

## Labs

Here are the labs I have completed (utilities is main branch), each focused on different aspects of operating systems:

- **Utilities**
- **System Calls**
- **Page Tables**
- **Traps**
- **Multithreading**

Each directory in this repository corresponds to one lab. Inside each directory, you will find the modified xv6 source code and a brief report describing my approach and any challenges I encountered.

## Usage

To run any of these labs, clone this repository, navigate to the specific lab directory, and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file for building and running the xv6 operating system with modifications for that lab.

## Contributing

While these solutions are for educational purposes, feedback and suggestions for improvement are always welcome. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
